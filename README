## Privacy and anonimity tutorial for journalists

This is a projecto to participate at the Mozilla Open Leadership project. As tasks to do, we have to create an Open Canvas and a Roadmap for our project. As the original document was a Google presentation, I decided to create a web version, with html and browseable.

This is the work in progress. Currently Open Canvas is working.

Project is based on Jekyll static website system. You can clone this repo and modified your files inside ```/docs``` folder. Inside ```_canvas``` folder you will find a document for each canvas' section.
